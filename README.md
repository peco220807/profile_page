# <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/umenzi/umenzi/main/wave.gif" width="30px"> Hi there

My name is Saparbay Symbat, and I am a second-year Bachelor’s student at Astana IT University, studying Software Engineering.

Only recently, I started interesting in Machine Learning and LLMs — and it all started with a simple curiosity about Data Science and my friends began getting into AI, experimenting with models, talking about 
computer vision and LLMs… It feels like something powerful and transformative so  I started too

Outside of tech, I’m a person of small joys like playing sudoku, go and listening music
